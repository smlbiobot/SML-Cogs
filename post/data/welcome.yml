      The RoyaleAPI Clan Family was originally known as the Reddit Alpha Clan Family
      and then briefly as the 100 Thieves Clan Family. Home to professional players
      that eventually moved on to play at CRNAO, King’s Cup, and CRL, our family
      fosters an environment where casual and competitive styles of play can both flourish.


      Our clan family boasts a top 25 global flagship clan and a system of
      "feeder" clans where we help our players learn, grow, and enhance their skills
      through a highly active & supportive discord server.
